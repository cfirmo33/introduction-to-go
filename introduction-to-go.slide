* Agenda

This workshop is aimed at programmers with experience in another programming language and want to learn how to apply their skills to Go.

This workshop consists of five main sections:

- Basic Syntax
- Advanced Syntax
- Development environment and tooling
- The standard library
- Packages and applications

After each section we'll have time for questions.

As we work through the day there will be less of me talking, and more exercises to help you learn Go via doing.

* One more thing ...

This isn't a lecture, it's a conversation.

If you don't understand something, or think what you're hearing is incorrect, speak up.

* The Go programming language

- Modern
- Compact, concise, general-purpose
- Imperative, statically type-checked, dynamically type-safe
- Garbage-collected
- Compiles to native code, statically linked
- Fast compilation, efficient execution

Designed by programmers for programmers!

* Safety

Typed, and type safe

 var i int = -1
 var u uint = 200

 i = u   // nope, incompatible types

Array accesses are bounds checked

 s := make([]string, 10)

 for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {
         // oops
 }

* Safety (cont.)

No dangling pointers, return a stack value from a function with impunity.

- Compiler will move allocations to the heap if required.
- Escape analysis will move them back if not.

All memory is zeroed if not explicitly initialised

 var q int       // initialised to 0
 var f = 7       // initialised to 7, type defaults to int

No implicit conversions; booleans and integers are not aliases

 i := 2
 if i { ... }    // nope, no coercion to bool

* Good support for concurrency and communication

- Multicore is a reality.
- Multiprocessing is not a solution.
- Networking support baked into the standard library, integrated into the runtime.

* Garbage collected

Go is a garbage collected language.

- Eliminates the bookkeeping errors related to ownership of shared values.
- Eliminates an entire class of use after free and memory leak bugs.
- Enables simpler, cleaner, APIs.

The garbage collector handles heaps into the 100's of GB range, and is designed for extremely low "stop the world" pauses. In Go 1.7 these pauses are now less than 100 microseconds.

* Speed

Go is often noted for its fast compilation, but this is only one facet of the idea of Go being a _fast_ language to program in.

"False dichotomy of static languages being 'slow and painful' and dynamic languages being 'fast and fun'" -Rob Pike

"Clumsy type systems drive people to dynamically typed languages" -Robert Griesemer

Go is an attempt to demonstrate that a language can be both fast in terms of the programs it produces and fast (productive?) for the authors.

* Opinionated

Go is an opinionated language.

- Unused local variables are an error.
- Unused imports are also an error.
- The compiler does not issue warnings, only errors.
- A single way to format code as defined by `go`fmt`.

* Hello, http!

.play src/hellohttp/hellohttp.go

* Basic Syntax

* Basic Syntax 

In this section we will walk through the basic syntax of a short Go program.

For this section all the code exercises will be inside this slide deck itself.

At the end of this section you'll know:

- How to declare constants and variables
- How to write `for` loops and use `if`.
- How types work.
- How to write your own functions.
- How packages and `import` statements work.

* Constants

A good place to start talking about Go are _Constants_.

Constants are values that do not change.

Here are some examples of constants:

 1
 "hello"
 false
 1.3

These are called _literal_constants_ because the value of evaluating each of these is the constant itself.

* Types of constants

There are six kinds of constants

- integer constants: `1`, `0`, `-6`, `9999999999999999999`, …
- floating point constants: `3.14`, `7.5e-2`, …
- complex number constants (rare): `1`-`0.707i`, …
- string constants: `"Hello,`東京"`, … 
- rune constants: `'a'`, `'す'`, `'シ'`, `'1'`, …
- boolean constants: `true`, `false`

* const

To make a constant, we declare one with the `const` keyword.

.play -edit src/const/const1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Whenever you see a *Run* button on a slide, you can execute the code.

- Press the *Run* button now and see what happens. 
- Press the *Close* button to close the output window.

You can also edit the code right here in the slide.

- Edit the code to replace my name, with yours.
- All source code in Go is UTF-8, you can use Kanji.
- Press the *Run* button to see the results.
- If you make a mistake, just reload the page.

* Identifiers

This is a good time to talk about _identifiers_.

An identifier is a name your give to something in your code.

In Go an identifier is any word that starts with a _letter_.

.play -edit src/identifier/identifier1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

A letter is anything that Unicode defines to be a letter, this includes Kanji, Cyrillic, Latin, etc.

- Identifiers are not restricted to ASCII, edit the slide and change `students` to `学生の` and press *Run*.
- If you make a mistake, just reload the page.

* Identifiers (cont.)

An identifier must start with a unicode letter, or the underscore character, `_`.

Numbers are not permitted at the start of an identifier, but can appear later in the identifier.

.play -edit src/identifier/identifier2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Here are some examples of _invalid_ identifiers.

- Change the name of the identifier so that the program compiles.
- Press the *Run* button to see the results.
- If you make a mistake, just reload the page.

* Comments

Go supports two kinds of comments:

- Inline comments, which start with a double forward slash, `//`.
- Block comments, which start with a forward slash and a star, `/*`, and end with a star and forward slash, `*/`.

.play -edit src/comments/comments1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Code that is commented out will not be compiled or run.

- Remove the comments in this program so it compiles.
- Press the *Run* button to see the results, it should compile and print `1`2`3`.
- If you make a mistake, just reload the page.

* Declarations

There are six kinds of _declarations_ in Go, we've seen one of them already.

They are:

- `const`: declares a new constant.
- `var`: declares a new variable.
- `type`: declares a new type.
- `func`: declares a new function, or method.
- `package`: declares the package this `.go` source file belongs to.
- `import`: declares that this package imports declarations from another. 

We'll cover each of the remaining five declarations in this section.

* Variables

A variable holds a value that can be changed over time.

You _declare_ a new variable with the `var` declaration.

.play -edit src/variable/variable1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Just like constants, variable _identifiers_ can be any any valid unicode word.

- Press the *Run* button to see the result.

_note_: The circumference is printed in scientific notation 😕, that's ok, we'll talk about how to fix it later when we talk about the `fmt` package.

* Unused variable declarations

Unused variables are often the source of bugs. If you declare a variable in the scope of your function but do not use it, the Go compiler will complain.

If the variable is unused, you should delete it, or assign it temporarily to the magic variable called `_`.

.play -edit src/variable/variable2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program has four unused variables.

- Fix the program by removing the comment from the two lines at the bottom.
- Delete, or comment out, the declaration of `自転車` as it is unused.
- Press the *Run* button to check that your program compiles.

* Statements

A _statement_ is a command to do something:

- _Declare_a_new_integer_variable_x_and_assign_it_the_value_10_.
- _Add_4_to_the_value_of_x_and_store_the_result_in_y_.
- _While_x_less_than_20_perform_these_statements_.

There are several kinds of statements in Go, we've seen a few already. The most common statements are:

- Declarations: `const`pi`=`3.14159265359`, `type`Counter`int32`, …
- Assignments: `count`=`count`+`1`, …
- Increment/Decrement: `x++`, `y--`
- Conditionals: `if`…`{`…`}`else`{`…`}`, `switch`{`…`}`
- Loops: `for`…`{`…`}`
- Control flow: `break`, `fallthrough`, `continue`, `goto`, `return`.

* Assignment

It is common that you need to change the value stored in a variable, this is called _Assignment_.

.play -edit src/assignment/assignment1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

In this example, we declare

- Press *Run* to check that program prints, `1`, `2`, `4`.
# - Update the program to declare a new variable, `z`, which has a value 2x larger than `y`.

* Assignment (cont.)

You can only assign a new value to _variables_.

.play -edit src/assignment/assignment2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

It is a syntax error to assign a new value to a constant.

- Press *Run* and see the program does not compile.
- Edit the sample code to change the declaration of `x` from a constant (`const`) to a variable (`var`).
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, 2.

* Increment and decrement

Go supports a limited form of variable post-increment and post-deincrement, ie. `x++`, `x--`.

.play -edit src/increment/increment1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

- Press *Run* and see the program prints `2`,
- Edit the sample code to subtract `1` from `i` using the deincrement operator `i--`.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, 0.

* Increment and decrement (cont.)

`i++` and `i--` are _statements_, not an _expressions_, they do not produce a value.

.play -edit src/increment/increment2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program has a syntax error. 

- Edit the sample code to correct the error by moving the `i++` statement above the declaration of `var`j`.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, 2, 2.

* Looping

Go has a single `for` loop construct that combines

- `while` _condition_ `{`…`}`
- `do`{`…`}`while` _condition_
- `do`{`…`}`until` _condition_

into one syntax.

- `for` _(init_statement)_; _condition_; _(post_statement)_ `{`…`}`

The parts of a `for` statement are:

- init statement: used to initalise the loop variable; `i`=`0`.
- condition: user to test if the loop is done; `i`<`10`, `true` means keep looping.
- post statement: user to increment the loop variable; `i++`, `i`=`i`-`1`.

* Looping (cont.) 

Let's practice using loops.

.play -edit src/loops/loops1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program counts from `1` to `10`, can you make it print only the _even_ numbers.

- Edit the program to make it print only the even numbers between `1` and `10`, inclusive.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`.

_note_: you do not need to put `(` braces around the `for` condition `)`. In fact, if you do it's a syntax error. Try it.

* Looping (cont.) 

Let's practice counting down, this is where you would use a `while` loop in other languages.

.play -edit src/loops/loops2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program counts down from `10` to `1`, can you make it count from `7` to `3`.

- Edit the program to make it print only the numbers from `7` down to `3`.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, `7`, `6`, `5`, `4`, `3`.

_note_: this `for` loop only has a _condition_, there is no _init_statement_ or _post_statement_, so we can omit the semicolons, `;`.

* Conditional statements

Go has two conditional statements, `if` and `switch`.

`if` is used to choose between two choices based on a _condition_.

 if v > 0 {
         println("v is greater than zero")
 } else {
         println("v is less than or equal to zero")
 }

In some cases the body of the `else` block may be omitted. This is very common when checking preconditions in a method of a function.

 if v == 0 {
         // nothing to do
         return
 }
 // handle v

* if

Let's revisit our previous even numbers `for` loop example.

.play -edit src/conditionals/conditionals1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program counts from `1` to `10`, can you make it print only the _even_ numbers.

- Uncomment the `if`i%2`==`0`{` and `}` lines to make the program print only the even numbers between `1` and `10`.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`.

_note_: `%` is the _modulo_ operator in Go. All even numbers divide wholly by `2`, leaving `0` as their _modulo_ (or remainder).

* continue

Unlike languages like Java, `if` statements in Go are often used as _guard_clauses_.

We say that when everything is true the code reads from the top to the bottom of the page.

We can rewrite the previous program using a new statement, `continue`, which _skips_ the body of the loop.

.play -edit src/conditionals/conditionals2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

- Uncomment the `if`i%1`==`1`{`, `continue`, and `}` lines.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`.

* break

This program is an _infinite_loop_. There is no _condition_expression_ in the `for` loop.

We can use the `break` statement, which breaks out of the _current_ loop, to fix it.

.play -edit src/conditionals/conditionals3/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

- Uncomment the `if`i`>`10`{`, `break`, and `}` lines.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`.

* Type inference

In the examples so far we've avoided talking about types, this is because Go supports _type_inference_.

Type inference lets you omit the type of a variable during declaration.

For example:

 var i = 7

Go sees that `i` is being declared and initalised with the value `7`, so the compiler infers the type of `i` is an `int`.

However if we did

 var s = "seven"

Go sees that `s` is being initalised with the _string_ `"seven"`, so the compiler infers the type of `s` is a `string`.

* Explicit type declaration

Sometimes you will want to tell Go to use a specific type.

You do this when you declare a variable:

 var i int = 4
 var s string = "おはようございます"

Which tells the compiler that you are declaring `i` explicitly to be an `int` with the value `7`, and `s` to be a `string` with the value `"おはようございます"`

We'll talk about the kinds of types that Go supports on the next slide.

* Types

Go is a strongly typed language, like Java, C, C++, and Python. Go has nine kinds of types, they are:

- strings: `string`.
- signed integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`.
- unsigned integers: `uint8`, `uint6`, `uint32`, `uint64`.
- aliases: `byte`, `rune`, `int`, `uint`.
- booleans: `bool`.
- IEEE floating point: `float32`, `float64`.
- Complex types: `complex64`, `complex128`.
- Compound types: `array`, `slice`, `map`, `struct`.
- Pointer types: `*int`, `*bytes.Buffer`.

* String types

Strings are the most common data type in Go programs.

String types behave much as you would expect in other languages.

.play -edit src/strings/strings1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Strings may be _concatenated_ with the `+` operator.

- Press *Run* to see the result.

_note_: In Go an empty string is `""`, not `null` or `nil`.

* Integer types

Integer types are the second most common in Go.

Integer types come in two types; _signed_ and _unsigned_.

Integer types also come in several sizes, represented by the number of bits they represent;

- Signed integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`.
- Unsigned integers: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`.

Go has two integer types

- `int`, alias for `int32` or `int64` depending on platform.
- `uint`, alias for `uint32` or `uint64` depending on platform.

whose size depends on the platform you used to build your Go program.

* Integer types (cont.)

Why does Go support so many kinds of integer types?

Different _sized_ integer types can accomodate different ranges of numbers.

.play -edit src/types/types1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program contains two type errors.

- Press *Run* to discover the two type errors.
- Fix the program by changing the declared types of `x` and `y`.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints the correct answer, `400`, `-7`

* Functions

Now it's time to talk about _functions_.

All Go you write is made up of functions, in fact, you've been writing functions all along.

.play -edit src/functions/functions1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This is the same program as the previous example, showing the _function_declaration_, which was previously hidden.

- All Go programs start in a function called `main`, we call this the _main_function_.

* func

You can declare your own functions with the `func` declaration.

A function's name must be a valid identifier, just like `const` and `var`.

.play -edit src/functions/functions2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

This program declares two functions, `main` and `hello`.

- Uncomment the `println("こんにちは")` statement in `func`hello`.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints こんにちは three times.

_note_: `println` is a _built_in_ function provided, you don't need to declare it.

* Function parameters

To make functions useful, you often need to pass _arguments_ to a function.

To pass an argument to a function, the type of the argument and the type of the function's _formal_parameter_ must be the same.

.play -edit src/functions/functions3/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

In this program the type of the argument passed to `hello` does not match the type of the `name` parameter.

- Fix the declaration of `hello` so that the type of the parameter matches the type of the argument provided.
- Press *Run* and check the program compiles and prints `こんにちは`David`.

* Packages

A package is the unit in which software is shared and reused in Go. All Go code is arranged into packages.

Each source file in a package must begin with the same `package` declaration.

A package's name must be a valid identifier, just like `const`, `var`, and `func`.

.play -edit src/packages/packages1/main.go

This is the same example as the previous slide, revealing the `package` declaration.

`package`main` is the name of the package which contains the entry point to your program, `func`main`.

* main packages

This program has the wrong `package` declaration.

.play -edit src/packages/packages2/main.go

- Press *Run* and observe the compile error.
- Change the `package` declaration to make the program compile.
- Press *Run* to check that program prints its greeting.

* Import

The final declaration we'll cover in this section is the _import_ declaration.

The `import` declaration allows you to use code from other _packages_ into your package.

When you `import` a package, the _public_ types, functions, variables, types, and constants, are available with a prefix of the package's name.

 time.Now	// denotes the Now function in package time

Note that

 import "fmt"
 import "time"

and

 import (
         "fmt"
         "time"
 )

both import the `fmt` and `time` packages. The syntax is different, but they are equivalent.

* Import (cont.)

The `import` declaration must appear _after_ the `package` declaration, but before any `type`, `const`, `var`, or `func` declarations.

.play -edit src/imports/imports1/main.go 

This program does not compile as the `import` declaration is in the wrong place.

- Move the `var`now`=`time.Now()` declaration _below_ the `import` declaration.
- Press *Run* to check that program prints the current time.

* Import (cont.)

Packages contain both _public_ and _private_ symbols. We also call these _exported_ and _not_exported_, respectively.

.play -edit src/imports/imports2/main.go 

This program does not compile as it refers to two _private_ symbols.

- Fix the program by using the correct case for `Println` and `Time`.
- Press *Run* to check that program prints the current time.

_note_: If you are running this slide from [[https://go-talks.golang.org/][gotalks.golang.org]], the time may be reported as `2009-11-10`23:00:00`+0000`UTC`. This is a technical limitation.

* fmt package

Do you remember this program?

.play -edit src/imports/imports3/main.go

Here it is again, showing the `func`, `package` and `import` declarations making it a complete Go program.

This program also uses the `Println` function from the `fmt` package, which is more capable than the built in `println` function.

- Press *Run* to see how `fmt.Println` prints this output.

* Recap

Now you know the basics of Go!

You've learnt:

- How to declare constants and variables
- How to write `for` loops and use `if`.
- How types work.
- How to write your own functions.
- How packages and `import` statements work.

Time for a quick break!

* Advanced Syntax

* Advanced Syntax

This section builds on the previous by exploring each of the things we learnt in a little more detail.

In this section we'll use the Go Playground, a simple online code editor to perform our exercises.

* Coding style

All Go code is formatted according to a single style guide which is enforced with a tool called `gofmt`

Having one single style that all Go code is formatted in improves readability and avoids the time wasted arguing about code formatting.

"Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite."
.caption [[https://go-proverbs.github.io/][Go Proverb]].

The Go playground can format your code according to the canonical Go style.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/0Hz57BQdTA][this link]] and press the *Format* button to see this in action.

* Zero value

In previous examples we've written code like this

 var name = "go"
 var counter = 1

Which both _declares_ and _initalises_ the variables `counter` and `name` respectively. What happens if we have code like this?

.code src/zerovalue/zerovalue1/main.go

What will ths print?

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/jioUB0t_LW][this link]] and press the *Run* button to see this in action.

* Zero value (cont.)

In Go, there is no unitialised memory. The Go runtime will always ensure that the memory allocated for each variable is initalised before use.

If we write something like 

 var name string
 var counter int

Then the memory assigned to the variables `name` and `counter` will be zeroed, as we have not provided an _initaliser_.

- The value of `name` will be `""` because that is the value of a string with zero length.
- The value of `counter` will be zero, because that is the value of an `int` if we wrote `0` to its memory location.

* Zero value (cont.)

Every type in Go has an associated _zero_value_. The value of that variable if we wrote zeros to its memory.

- The zero value for integer types: `int`, `int8`, `uint`, `uint64`, etc, is `0`.
- The zero value for floating point types: `float32`, `float64`, `complex128`, etc, is `0.0`.
- The zero value for arrays is the zero value for each element, ie. `[3]int` is `0`, `0`, `0`.
- The zero value for slices is `nil`.
- The zero value for structs is the zero value for each field.

* Equality

As Go is a strongly typed language, for two variables to be equal, both their _type_and_their_value_ must be equal.

Trying to compare two variables of _different_ types is detected at runtime.

.code src/equality/equality1/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/LwiJm2xuXK][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Fix the program by declaring `x` and `y` to be the _same_ type.
- Press the *Run* button and confirm the program now prints `true`.

* Type conversions

Sometimes you have variables of different integer types, you can _convert_ from one type to another using a conversion _expression_.

The expression `T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T`.

.code -edit src/types/types2/main.go

In this example the assignment of `y`=`x` fails because `x` and `y` are different integer types.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/wvG41C0lH4][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Fix the program by _converting_ `x` to an `int` with `int(x)`.
- Press the *Run* button and confirm the program now prints `700`.

* Type conversions (cont.)

If you have variables of different _widths_, you can _convert_ from one type to another.

.code -edit src/types/types3/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/l4Q48pWAla][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Fix the program by _converting_ `x` to an `int64` with `int64(x)`.
- Press the *Run* button and confirm the program now prints `32000`.

* Type conversions (cont.)

We can do the opposite and convert a wider type to a narrower type.

.code -edit src/types/types4/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/NbNwRjbmRu][this link]] and press the *Run* button. Does it print the answer you expected?
- Fix the program by _declaring_ `y` as an `int32`.
- Press the *Run* button and confirm the program now prints `64000`.

* Integer overflow

Whenever you declare a variable in Go, you have to choose how many bits of memory it will consume.

When you convert a variable with a _smaller_ number of bits to a variable with a larger number of bits, this is fine, because they all fit.

When you convert a variable with a _larger_ number of bits to a variable with a smaller number of bits there is a risk of truncation, because there are less bits available to represent your number.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/NbNwRjbmRu][this link]] and press the *Run* button. Does it print the answer you expected?
- Fix the program by reducing the value of `x`. Hint: the value needs to be less than 33,000.
- Press the *Run* button and confirm the program now prints `y` correctly.

* Short declaration syntax

As you've probably noticed, Go has several ways to declare variables. All three of these are the same

 var x = 0
 var x int = 0
 var x int

If you've come from a language like Ruby or Python, you're probably wondering if this very common operation can be made more concise. Indeed it can.

 x := 0

This is what we call a _short_declaration_, which is the same as 
 
 var x int = 0

Short declaration is very common in Go programs, you'll see it everywhere, so let's do some exercises to familarise you with its use.

* Short declaration syntax (cont.)

A common use of the short declaration syntax is in `for` loops. Consider this program

 var i int
 for i = 1; i < 11; i++ {
         fmt.Println(i)
 }

This can be also written as

 for i := 1; i < 11; i++ {
         fmt.Println(i)
 }

[[https://play.golang.org/p/3Vl75w72JO][This program]] contains two `var` declarations and two `for` loops.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/3Vl75w72JO][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Rewrite the program using the short declaration syntax; there should be no `var` declarations, only `:=`.

* Scope

We've talked about all the ways to declare a variable in Go, now we need to discuss scope.

.code -edit src/scope/scope1/main.go

This program declares `x` four times. All four `x` 's are _different_ because they exist in different scopes.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/nIcOXVXgwl][this link]] and press the *Run* button.

* Scope (cont.)

The scope of a declaration is bound to the closest pair of curly braces, `{` and `}`.

.code -edit src/scope/scope2/main.go

In this example, we declare `x` to be 100 inside `main`, and 200 inside `f`.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/Xfi3GOhTiC][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did the program print what you expected?

* Scope (cont.)

What do you expect this program will print?

.code -edit src/scope/scope3/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/7uxrebFzmK][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did you guess the right answer?

* Scope (cont.)

What do you expect this program will print?

.code -edit src/scope/scope4/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/7hpZre9LhI][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did you guess the right answer?

* Shadowing

What you are seeing is called _shadowing_.

.code -edit src/scope/scope5/main.go /START1 OMIT/,/END1 OMIT/

Most of you will be comfortable with a _function_scoped_ variable shadowing a _package_scoped_ variable.

.code -edit src/scope/scope5/main.go /START2 OMIT/,/END2 OMIT/

But a _block_scoped_ variable shadowing a _function_scoped_ variable may be surprising.


* Slices

The next kind of type to discuss is the _Slice_. 

A slice is an ordered collection of values of a _single_ type.

The syntax for declaring a slice variable is very similar to declaraing a _scalar_ variable.

 var i int      // an int called i
 var j []int    // a slice of ints called j

In this example, 

- `i` is a variable of type `int`. 
- `j` is a variable of type `[]int`, that is, a slice of `int`.

Slices are very important in Go programs, so we'll spend a bit of time discussiong them.

_note_: A slice is _not_ an array. Go also supports arrays, but you'll see later than they aren't very common, or very easy to use, so we won't discuss them at the moment.

* How large is a slice?

If I declare a slice, `[]int`, how many items can it hold?

The _zero_value_ of a slice is empty, that is, it has a _length_ of zero; it can hold 0 items.

.code -edit src/slices/slices1/main.go

We can retrieve the length of a slice with the built-in `len` function.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/gZYvdE2zbT][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did you guess the right answer?

* Making a slice

We can create a slice with space to hold items using the built-in `make` function.

.code -edit src/slices/slices2/main.go

In this example, on the first line `var i []int` declares `i` to be a slice of `int`.

On the second line, `i` is _assigned_ the result of `make([]int,`20)`.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/i_IWqjik6u][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did `fmt.Println(len(i))` print the result you expected?

* Making a slice (cont.)

Because declaring a slice variable and initalising it with `make` is a common operation, it is common to see the _short_variable_declaration_ used to combine this operations.

.code -edit src/slices/slices3/main.go

This example declares `i` _and_ initalises it to be a slice of `int` with a length of 20.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/b92SJ0Gx9s][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did `fmt.Println(len(i))` print the result you expected?

* Slice exercises

Let's do a quick exercise to familarise yourself with using slices.

.code -edit src/slices/slices4/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/AJk1Jgp1iE][this link]] for instructions.
- Declare a variable called `i` which is a slice of 5 `int`.
- Declare a variable called `f` which is a slice of 9 `float64`.
- Declare a variable called `s` which is a slice of 4 `string`.
- Does your program print the expected result, `5`9`4`?

* Index expressions

To access, or assign, the contents of a slice element at index `i`, use the form `s[i]`.

Slices are zero indexed, so `s[0]` is the 1st element, `s[1]` is the second element, and so on.

When the _index_expression_ appears on the _left_hand_side_ of the equals operator, `=`

 s[7] = 20

We are assigning the number 20 to the 8'th element of the slice `s`.

When the _index_expression_ appears on the _right_hand_side_ of the equals operator, `=`

 x := s[7]

We are assigning the value at the 8th element of `s` to the variable `x`.

* Slice zero value

We saw earlier that the _zero_value_ of the slice

 var s []int

was and empty slice, a slice with length of zero.

What is the value of each of the elements of a newly created, with make, slice?

.play -edit src/slices/slices5/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/kGh_C1l6KW][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Did the program print the result you expected?

* Slice initialisation

We want to create an `[]int` slice of the first 10 prime numbers, how could we do this?

One solution could be to create the slice and assign a value to each element in the slice.

.play -edit src/slices/slices6/main.go

* Slice initialisation (cont.)

Doing this manually is verbose and boring; how would you do this for the first 50 primes?

Go supports a method of assignment where we both _declare_ and _initalise_ the slice at once.

.play -edit src/slices/slices7/main.go

This is called the _composite_literal_ syntax.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/P-eBqzPCWh][this link]] and complete the exercise.

* append

So far we've been using slices with a known length. You can extend the contents of a slice with the built-in `append` function.

.play -edit src/slices/slices8/main.go

`append` increases the length of the slice to accomodate the new items, then returns a new slice value.

You can `append` mutliple values in one statement, providing they are all the same type.

.link https://blog.golang.org/slices Further reading: Arrays, slices (and strings): The mechanics of 'append' (blog.golang.org)

* Subslices

What if we have a large slice, and want to refer to only a part of it. 

We call this slicing a slice, or _subslicing_.

Subslicing looks similar to the _indexing_ operation we saw a few slide ago, except it refers to a range of slice indexes.

.play -edit src/slices/slices12/main.go

The expression `brothers[0:3]` evaluates to a slice of the 1st to 3rd Marx brother.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/d1-jl42aTF][this link]] and complete the exercise.

* Subslices (cont.)

An important thing to remember when slicing a slice, is that both slices refer to the _same_ underying data.

.play -edit src/slices/slices10/main.go

To create two independant slice values, you would use the `copy` function, which we'll discuss later.

* Bounds checking

Each slice has a length which is decided when it is made.

You can increase the length of the slice with the `append` function, and create a smaller slice from a larger one using the slice operator.

What happens if you accidentally exceed the bounds of the slice?

.play -edit src/slices/slices11/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/mIWm0a1amp][this link]] and press the *Run* button.
- Comment out `fmt.Println(primes[-1])` and see what happens.

* Multiple assignment

Go allows you to perform multiple assignments and declarations in one statement.

For example, if we wanted to declare, `x`, `y`, and `z`, with the values `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively. We could write

 var x = 1
 var y = 2
 var z = 3

We can write the same thing like this

 var x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/d2hDJQAfkt][this link]] for some examples of multiple declaration.

* Multiple return values

Multiple assignment is important to understand because you can return multiple values from a function.

 func f(i int)

This is a function declaration for `f` which takes one argument, an `int`.

 func g(i int, j int, k string) int

This is a function declaration for `g`, which takes three arguments, two `int` s and a `string`, and returns an `int`.

 func h(i, j int) (int, int, string)

This is a function declaration for `h`, which takes two arguments, two `ints`, and returns three values, two `int` s and a `string`.

* Multiple return values (cont.)

Your program must return the number of values specified in the function signature.

.play -edit src/functions/functions4/main.go

* Assigning multiple return values

When you call a function that returns multiple values, you must assign _all_ of them or _none_ of them.

 func f() (int, bool, string)

 func main() {
         a, b, c := f()
         fmt.Println(a, b, c)
 }

`f` returns three values, so we assign them to `a`, `b`, and `c` using the short declaration syntax.

If we wanted to use only the first and third values we can ignore the second by assigning it to the underscore variable, `_`.

 func main() {
         a, _, c := f()
         fmt.Println(a, c)
 }

* Maps

Go has a built in Hash Map type, called a `map`.

Maps map values of key type K to values of type V

 var m map[string]int

Just like making a slice, making a map is acomplished with the `make` built-in.

.play -edit src/maps/maps1/main.go

* Inserting values into a map

Inserting a value into a map looks similar to assigning a value to a slice element.

.play -edit src/maps/maps2/main.go

If an entry already exits with that key, it will be overwritten.

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/a-V5I0nZ5l][this link]] and complete the exercise.

_note_: maps are always _unordered_.

* Compact literal initalisation

Just like slices, maps support compact literal initalisation, which declares and initalises the map.

.play -edit src/maps/maps3/main.go

* Retrieving a values from a map

Just like a slice, you can retrieve the value stored in a map with the syntax `m[key]`.

If it is present the value will be returned, if not the _zero_value_ will be returned.

.play -edit src/maps/maps4/main.go

* Checking if a map value exists

In the previous slide we saw that `moons["Neptune"]` returned `0`.

How can we tell if Neptune actually has no moons, or if `0` was returned because there is no entry for Neptune?

Map lookups support a second syntax.

.play -edit src/maps/maps5/main.go

* Deleting a value from a map

To delete a value from a map, you use the built in `delete` function.

.play -edit src/maps/maps6/main.go

* Iterating over a map

If we wanted to print out all the values in a map we can use a form of the `for` syntax which is known as `range`.

.play -edit src/range/range1/main.go

`range` loops over each entry in the map, assigning the map key to `name`, and the map value to `pop`.

* Range over slices

We say previously that `for`range` works with maps, it also works with slices.

.play -edit src/range/range2/main.go

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/AmQW-OrPC1][this link]] and complete the exercise.
- If you cannot figure it out, don't worry, there is an answer on the next slide.

* Switch

If you completed the previous exercise you may have written something like this

.play -edit src/range/range2a/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Heavily nested `if`else`if` blocks are discouraged in Go.

Instead we can use the other condition statement, `switch`.

* Switch (cont.)

`switch` can be used 

.play -edit src/switch/switch1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* fmt

Let's conclude this section by talking about the fmt package.

`fmt` standard for formatted printing; the name is inhereted from Go's Plan 9 legacy.

We've use `fmt.Println` a lot up to this point, but the `fmt` package has many other useful functions.

We'll focus on `fmt.Printf`, the `f` stands for _formatted_output_.

Here is an example.

.play -edit src/fmt/fmt1/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/UuzPWcwDrE][this link]] to experiment.

* Formatting verbs

If you're used to languages like Python or C, you're probably used to the idea of _formatting_verbs_.

The `fmt` package supports a large number of formatting verbs and modifiers. In the previous example you saw `%s` and `%d`, for `string` and `int` respectively.

The `fmt` package is smart enough to spot when you use the wrong formatting verb, or don't provide enough arguments to `fmt.Printf`.

.play -edit src/fmt/fmt2/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Formatting verbs (cont.)

Having to choose the correct verb that matches the type of the value you want to print is boring.

To make it easier to use `fmt.Printf` in the simple case, you can use the `%v` verb, which know how to print _any_ value.

.play -edit src/fmt/fmt3/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

- Follow [[https://play.golang.org/p/B-E7JOJ1Db][this link]] to experiment with a few more formatting verbs.
